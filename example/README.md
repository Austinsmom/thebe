# Basic example

Serve this example directory:

    python -m http.server

Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Or simply [browse it online](https://github.com/nthiery/thebelab/).

The example uses by default https://beta.mybinder.org as computational
backend, and fetches the thebelab javascript library from the web. It
can be configured to use kernels from a specific notebook server and a
local installation of thebelab.
